# LCMicrosim
Hi, welcome to the model I built for my masterâ€™s thesis. Before going into the model itself I would recommend you to read my manuscript to get a feeling of what is going on in general, the different sections, and what is the ultimate goal of this analysis. I very much hope that everything will be clear enough and in case it is not, and you want to know more about it, feel free to contact me for information. Enjoy it!

This study developed a microsimulation model to assess the cost-effectiveness of risk-based lung cancer screening strategies in a high-risk Norwegian population. Constructed on the natural history of the disease, the model simulated a cohort of 20,000 high-risk individuals (current or former smokers) aged 40 years over their lifetimes, incorporating scenarios with and without screening. The model used a Gompertz function for tumor growth and the Volume Doubling Time (VDT) to inform the outcome of screenings, aiming to reflect clinical dynamics more realistically. It also utilized the Two-Stage Clonal Expansion (TSCE) model to estimate initiation hazard functions tailored to specific risk profiles based on age and smoking history, allowing for precise risk stratification and calibrated screening approaches. Clinical outcomes evaluated included lung cancer incidence by age, stage distribution, and the number of lung cancer deaths, alongside economic outcomes like treatment and screening costs. The results indicated that implementing a screening policy, depending on specific eligibility criteria and screening intervals, is likely cost-effective compared to no screening. Economic evaluations included direct medical costs, diagnostic costs, and costs associated with the screening process itself, all calibrated to 2023 Nor wegian Krone (NOK). Our findings suggest potential benefits in detecting lung cancer at earlier stages, reducing mortality, and improving quality of life through targeted screening strategies. Specifically, the model forecasted shifts in lung cancer stage distribution and a reduction in lung cancer mortality at tributable to early detection provided by screening. However, the model suggested an overestimation of lung cancer incidence, which could positively impact the predicted cost-effectiveness, highlighting the need for model refinement. This overestimation underscores the importance of accurate disease modeling in predicting real-world impacts of health interventions. Overall, this research supports the implementation of risk-based screening policies in Norway, providing valuable insights for policymakers on optimizing and tailoring lung cancer screening programs. Further research is necessary to refine the model and incorporate a broader range of clinical data to enhance predictive accuracy and utility for health policymakers and confirm these findings under different scenarios and assumptions.
